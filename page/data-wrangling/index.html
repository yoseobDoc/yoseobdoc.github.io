<p>Have you ever wanted to take data in one format and turn it into a
different format? Of course you have! That, in very general terms, is
what this lecture is all about. Specifically, massaging data, whether in
text or binary format, until you end up with exactly what you wanted.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen some basic data wrangling in past lectures. Pretty
much any time you use the <code>|</code> operator, you are performing some kind of
data wrangling. Consider a command like <code>journalctl | grep -i intel</code>. It
finds all system log entries that mention Intel (case insensitive). You
may not think of it as wrangling data, but it is going from one format
(your entire system log) to a format that is more useful to you (just
the intel log entries). Most data wrangling is about knowing what tools
you have at your disposal, and how to combine them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start from the beginning. To wrangle data, we need two things:
data to wrangle, and something to do with it. Logs often make for a good
use-case, because you often want to investigate things about them, and
reading the whole thing isn&rsquo;t feasible. Let&rsquo;s figure out who&rsquo;s trying to
log into my server by looking at my server&rsquo;s log:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ssh myserver journalctl
</code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s far too much stuff. Let&rsquo;s limit it to ssh stuff:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ssh myserver journalctl | grep sshd
</code></pre></div><p>Notice that we&rsquo;re using a pipe to stream a <em>remote</em> file through <code>grep</code>
on our local computer! <code>ssh</code> is magical, and we will talk more about it
in the next lecture on the command-line environment. This is still way
more stuff than we wanted though. And pretty hard to read. Let&rsquo;s do
better:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ssh myserver <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;journalctl | grep sshd | grep &#34;Disconnected from&#34;&#39;</span> | less
</code></pre></div><p>Why the additional quoting? Well, our logs may be quite large, and it&rsquo;s
wasteful to stream it all to our computer and then do the filtering.
Instead, we can do the filtering on the remote server, and then massage
the data locally. <code>less</code> gives us a &ldquo;pager&rdquo; that allows us to scroll up
and down through the long output. To save some additional traffic while
we debug our command-line, we can even stick the current filtered logs
into a file so that we don&rsquo;t have to access the network while
developing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ ssh myserver 'journalctl | grep sshd | grep &quot;Disconnected from&quot;' &gt; ssh.log
$ less ssh.log
</code></pre><p>There&rsquo;s still a lot of noise here. There are <em>a lot</em> of ways to get rid
of that, but let&rsquo;s look at one of the most powerful tools in your
toolkit: <code>sed</code>.</p>
<p><code>sed</code> is a &ldquo;stream editor&rdquo; that builds on top of the old <code>ed</code> editor. In
it, you basically give short commands for how to modify the file, rather
than manipulate its contents directly (although you can do that too).
There are tons of commands, but one of the most common ones is <code>s</code>:
substitution. For example, we can write:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ssh myserver journalctl
 | grep sshd
 | grep <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Disconnected from&#34;</span>
 | sed <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s/.*Disconnected from //&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>What we just wrote was a simple <em>regular expression</em>; a powerful
construct that lets you match text against patterns. The <code>s</code> command is
written on the form: <code>s/REGEX/SUBSTITUTION/</code>, where <code>REGEX</code> is the
regular expression you want to search for, and <code>SUBSTITUTION</code> is the
text you want to substitute matching text with.</p>
<p>(You may recognize this syntax from the &ldquo;Search and replace&rdquo; section of our Vim
<a href="https://yoseobdoc.github.io/2020/editors/#advanced-vim">lecture notes</a>! Indeed, Vim uses a syntax for
searching and replacing that is similar to <code>sed</code>'s substitution command.
Learning one tool often helps you become more proficient with others.)</p>
<h2 id="regular-expressions">Regular expressions</h2>
<p>Regular expressions are common and useful enough that it&rsquo;s worthwhile to
take some time to understand how they work. Let&rsquo;s start by looking at
the one we used above: <code>/.*Disconnected from /</code>. Regular expressions are
usually (though not always) surrounded by <code>/</code>. Most ASCII characters
just carry their normal meaning, but some characters have &ldquo;special&rdquo;
matching behavior. Exactly which characters do what vary somewhat
between different implementations of regular expressions, which is a
source of great frustration. Very common patterns are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.</code> means &ldquo;any single character&rdquo; except newline</li>
<li><code>*</code> zero or more of the preceding match</li>
<li><code>+</code> one or more of the preceding match</li>
<li><code>[abc]</code> any one character of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code></li>
<li><code>(RX1|RX2)</code> either something that matches <code>RX1</code> or <code>RX2</code></li>
<li><code>^</code> the start of the line</li>
<li><code>$</code> the end of the line</li>
</ul>
<p><code>sed</code>'s regular expressions are somewhat weird, and will require you to
put a <code>\</code> before most of these to give them their special meaning. Or
you can pass <code>-E</code>.</p>
<p>So, looking back at <code>/.*Disconnected from /</code>, we see that it matches
any text that starts with any number of characters, followed by the
literal string &ldquo;Disconnected from ”. Which is what we wanted. But
{% comment %}
note: the spelling of &ldquo;trixy&rdquo; below is intentional; see <a href="https://github.com/missing-semester/missing-semester/pull/84">https://github.com/missing-semester/missing-semester/pull/84</a>
{% endcomment %}
beware, regular expressions are trixy. What if someone tried to log in
with the username &ldquo;Disconnected from&rdquo;? We&rsquo;d have:</p>
<pre><code>Jan 17 03:13:00 thesquareplanet.com sshd[2631]: Disconnected from invalid user Disconnected from 46.97.239.16 port 55920 [preauth]
</code></pre><p>What would we end up with? Well, <code>*</code> and <code>+</code> are, by default, &ldquo;greedy&rdquo;.
They will match as much text as they can. So, in the above, we&rsquo;d end up
with just</p>
<pre><code>46.97.239.16 port 55920 [preauth]
</code></pre><p>Which may not be what we wanted. In some regular expression
implementations, you can just suffix <code>*</code> or <code>+</code> with a <code>?</code> to make them
non-greedy, but sadly <code>sed</code> doesn&rsquo;t support that. We <em>could</em> switch to
perl&rsquo;s command-line mode though, which <em>does</em> support that construct:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">perl -pe <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s/.*?Disconnected from //&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We&rsquo;ll stick to <code>sed</code> for the rest of this, because it&rsquo;s by far the more
common tool for these kinds of jobs. <code>sed</code> can also do other handy
things like print lines following a given match, do multiple
substitutions per invocation, search for things, etc. But we won&rsquo;t cover
that too much here. <code>sed</code> is basically an entire topic in and of itself,
but there are often better tools.</p>
<p>Okay, so we also have a suffix we&rsquo;d like to get rid of. How might we do
that? It&rsquo;s a little tricky to match just the text that follows the
username, especially if the username can have spaces and such! What we
need to do is match the <em>whole</em> line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> | sed -E <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s/.*Disconnected from (invalid |authenticating )?user .* [^ ]+ port [0-9]+( \[preauth\])?$//&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s look at what&rsquo;s going on with a <a href="https://regex101.com/r/qqbZqh/2">regex
debugger</a>. Okay, so the start is still
as before. Then, we&rsquo;re matching any of the &ldquo;user&rdquo; variants (there are
two prefixes in the logs). Then we&rsquo;re matching on any string of
characters where the username is. Then we&rsquo;re matching on any single word
(<code>[^ ]+</code>; any non-empty sequence of non-space characters). Then the word
&ldquo;port&rdquo; followed by a sequence of digits. Then possibly the suffix
<code>[preauth]</code>, and then the end of the line.</p>
<p>Notice that with this technique, as username of &ldquo;Disconnected from&rdquo;
won&rsquo;t confuse us any more. Can you see why?</p>
<p>There is one problem with this though, and that is that the entire log
becomes empty. We want to <em>keep</em> the username after all. For this, we
can use &ldquo;capture groups&rdquo;. Any text matched by a regex surrounded by
parentheses is stored in a numbered capture group. These are available
in the substitution (and in some engines, even in the pattern itself!)
as <code>\1</code>, <code>\2</code>, <code>\3</code>, etc. So:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> | sed -E <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s/.*Disconnected from (invalid |authenticating )?user (.*) [^ ]+ port [0-9]+( \[preauth\])?$/\2/&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>As you can probably imagine, you can come up with <em>really</em> complicated
regular expressions. For example, here&rsquo;s an article on how you might
match an <a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html">e-mail
address</a>. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://emailregex.com/">not
easy</a>. And there&rsquo;s <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/201323/how-to-validate-an-email-address-using-a-regular-expression/1917982">lots of
discussion</a>.
And people have <a href="https://fightingforalostcause.net/content/misc/2006/compare-email-regex.php">written
tests</a>.
And <a href="https://mathiasbynens.be/demo/url-regex">test matrices</a>. You can
even write a regex for determining if a given number <a href="https://www.noulakaz.net/2007/03/18/a-regular-expression-to-check-for-prime-numbers/">is a prime
number</a>.</p>
<p>Regular expressions are notoriously hard to get right, but they are also
very handy to have in your toolbox!</p>
<h2 id="back-to-data-wrangling">Back to data wrangling</h2>
<p>Okay, so we now have</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ssh myserver journalctl
 | grep sshd
 | grep <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Disconnected from&#34;</span>
 | sed -E <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s/.*Disconnected from (invalid |authenticating )?user (.*) [^ ]+ port [0-9]+( \[preauth\])?$/\2/&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>sed</code> can do all sorts of other interesting things, like injecting text
(with the <code>i</code> command), explicitly printing lines (with the <code>p</code>
command), selecting lines by index, and lots of other things. Check <code>man sed</code>!</p>
<p>Anyway. What we have now gives us a list of all the usernames that have
attempted to log in. But this is pretty unhelpful. Let&rsquo;s look for common
ones:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ssh myserver journalctl
 | grep sshd
 | grep <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Disconnected from&#34;</span>
 | sed -E <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s/.*Disconnected from (invalid |authenticating )?user (.*) [^ ]+ port [0-9]+( \[preauth\])?$/\2/&#39;</span>
 | sort | uniq -c
</code></pre></div><p><code>sort</code> will, well, sort its input. <code>uniq -c</code> will collapse consecutive
lines that are the same into a single line, prefixed with a count of the
number of occurrences. We probably want to sort that too and only keep
the most common usernames:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ssh myserver journalctl
 | grep sshd
 | grep <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Disconnected from&#34;</span>
 | sed -E <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s/.*Disconnected from (invalid |authenticating )?user (.*) [^ ]+ port [0-9]+( \[preauth\])?$/\2/&#39;</span>
 | sort | uniq -c
 | sort -nk1,1 | tail -n10
</code></pre></div><p><code>sort -n</code> will sort in numeric (instead of lexicographic) order. <code>-k1,1</code>
means &ldquo;sort by only the first whitespace-separated column&rdquo;. The <code>,n</code>
part says &ldquo;sort until the <code>n</code>th field, where the default is the end of
the line. In this <em>particular</em> example, sorting by the whole line
wouldn&rsquo;t matter, but we&rsquo;re here to learn!</p>
<p>If we wanted the <em>least</em> common ones, we could use <code>head</code> instead of
<code>tail</code>. There&rsquo;s also <code>sort -r</code>, which sorts in reverse order.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s pretty cool, but what if we&rsquo;d like these extract only the usernames
as a comma-separated list instead of one per line, perhaps for a config file?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ssh myserver journalctl
 | grep sshd
 | grep <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Disconnected from&#34;</span>
 | sed -E <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s/.*Disconnected from (invalid |authenticating )?user (.*) [^ ]+ port [0-9]+( \[preauth\])?$/\2/&#39;</span>
 | sort | uniq -c

</code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s start with <code>paste</code>: it lets you combine lines (<code>-s</code>) by a given
single-character delimiter (<code>-d</code>; <code>,</code> in this case). But what&rsquo;s this <code>awk</code> business?</p>
<h2 id="awk----another-editor">awk &ndash; another editor</h2>
<p><code>awk</code> is a programming language that just happens to be really good at
processing text streams. There is <em>a lot</em> to say about <code>awk</code> if you were
to learn it properly, but as with many other things here, we&rsquo;ll just go
through the basics.</p>
<p>First, what does <code>{print $2}</code> do? Well, <code>awk</code> programs take the form of
an optional pattern plus a block saying what to do if the pattern
matches a given line. The default pattern (which we used above) matches
all lines. Inside the block, <code>$0</code> is set to the entire line&rsquo;s contents,
and <code>$1</code> through <code>$n</code> are set to the <code>n</code>th <em>field</em> of that line, when
separated by the <code>awk</code> field separator (whitespace by default, change
with <code>-F</code>). In this case, we&rsquo;re saying that, for every line, print the
contents of the second field, which happens to be the username!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if we can do something fancier. Let&rsquo;s compute the number of
single-use usernames that start with <code>c</code> and end with <code>e</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> | awk <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;$1 == 1 &amp;&amp; $2 ~ /^c[^ ]*e$/ { print $2 }&#39;</span> | wc -l
</code></pre></div><p>There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack here. First, notice that we now have a pattern
(the stuff that goes before <code>{...}</code>). The pattern says that the first
field of the line should be equal to 1 (that&rsquo;s the count from <code>uniq -c</code>), and that the second field should match the given regular
expression. And the block just says to print the username. We then count
the number of lines in the output with <code>wc -l</code>.</p>
<p>However, <code>awk</code> is a programming language, remember?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-awk" data-lang="awk">BEGIN { <span style="color:#a6e22e">rows</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span> }
<span style="color:#f92672">$</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span> <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&amp;&amp;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">$</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span> <span style="color:#f92672">~</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">/^c[^ ]*e$/</span> { <span style="color:#a6e22e">rows</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">$</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span> }
END { <span style="color:#66d9ef">print</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rows</span> }
</code></pre></div><p><code>BEGIN</code> is a pattern that matches the start of the input (and <code>END</code>
matches the end). Now, the per-line block just adds the count from the
first field (although it&rsquo;ll always be 1 in this case), and then we print
it out at the end. In fact, we <em>could</em> get rid of <code>grep</code> and <code>sed</code>
entirely, because <code>awk</code> <a href="https://backreference.org/2010/02/10/idiomatic-awk/">can do it
all</a>, but we&rsquo;ll
leave that as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<h2 id="analyzing-data">Analyzing data</h2>
<p>You can do math directly in your shell using <code>bc</code>, a calculator that can read
from STDIN! For example, add the numbers on each line together by concatenating
them together, delimited by <code>+</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> | paste -sd+ | bc -l
</code></pre></div><p>Or produce more elaborate expressions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">echo <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;2*(</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>data | paste -sd+<span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span><span style="color:#e6db74">)&#34;</span> | bc -l
</code></pre></div><p>You can get stats in a variety of ways.
<a href="https://github.com/nferraz/st"><code>st</code></a> is pretty neat, but if you already
have <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ssh myserver journalctl
 | grep sshd
 | grep <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Disconnected from&#34;</span>
 | sed -E <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s/.*Disconnected from (invalid |authenticating )?user (.*) [^ ]+ port [0-9]+( \[preauth\])?$/\2/&#39;</span>
 | sort | uniq -c
 | awk <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;{print $1}&#39;</span> | R --slave -e <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;x &lt;- scan(file=&#34;stdin&#34;, quiet=TRUE); summary(x)&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>R is another (weird) programming language that&rsquo;s great at data analysis
and <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">plotting</a>. We won&rsquo;t go into too
much detail, but suffice to say that <code>summary</code> prints summary statistics
for a vector, and we created a vector containing the input stream of
numbers, so R gives us the statistics we wanted!</p>
<p>If you just want some simple plotting, <code>gnuplot</code> is your friend:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ssh myserver journalctl
 | grep sshd
 | grep <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Disconnected from&#34;</span>
 | sed -E <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s/.*Disconnected from (invalid |authenticating )?user (.*) [^ ]+ port [0-9]+( \[preauth\])?$/\2/&#39;</span>
 | sort | uniq -c
 | sort -nk1,1 | tail -n10
 | gnuplot -p -e <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;set boxwidth 0.5; plot &#34;-&#34; using 1:xtic(2) with boxes&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="data-wrangling-to-make-arguments">Data wrangling to make arguments</h2>
<p>Sometimes you want to do data wrangling to find things to install or
remove based on some longer list. The data wrangling we&rsquo;ve talked about
so far + <code>xargs</code> can be a powerful combo.</p>
<p>For example, as seen in lecture, I can use the following command to uninstall
old nightly builds of Rust from my system by extracting the old build names
using data wrangling tools and then passing them via <code>xargs</code> to the
uninstaller:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">rustup toolchain list | grep nightly | grep -vE <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;nightly-x86&#34;</span> | sed <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s/-x86.*//&#39;</span> | xargs rustup toolchain uninstall
</code></pre></div><h2 id="wrangling-binary-data">Wrangling binary data</h2>
<p>So far, we have mostly talked about wrangling textual data, but pipes
are just as useful for binary data. For example, we can use ffmpeg to
capture an image from our camera, convert it to grayscale, compress it,
send it to a remote machine over SSH, decompress it there, make a copy,
and then display it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ffmpeg -loglevel panic -i /dev/video0 -frames <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span> -f image2 -

 | ssh mymachine <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;gzip -d | tee copy.jpg | env DISPLAY=:0 feh -&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div><h1 id="exercises">Exercises</h1>
<ol>
<li>Take this <a href="https://regexone.com/">short interactive regex tutorial</a>.</li>
<li>Find the number of words (in <code>/usr/share/dict/words</code>) that contain at
least three <code>a</code>s and don&rsquo;t have a <code>'s</code> ending. What are the three
most common last two letters of those words? <code>sed</code>'s <code>y</code> command, or
the <code>tr</code> program, may help you with case insensitivity. How many
of those two-letter combinations are there? And for a challenge:
which combinations do not occur?</li>
<li>To do in-place substitution it is quite tempting to do something like
<code>sed s/REGEX/SUBSTITUTION/ input.txt &gt; input.txt</code>. However this is a
bad idea, why? Is this particular to <code>sed</code>? Use <code>man sed</code> to find out
how to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Find your average, median, and max system boot time over the last ten
boots. Use <code>journalctl</code> on Linux and <code>log show</code> on macOS, and look
for log timestamps near the beginning and end of each boot. On Linux,
they may look something like:
<pre><code>Logs begin at ...
</code></pre><p>and</p>
<pre><code>systemd[577]: Startup finished in ...
</code></pre><p>On macOS, <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2018/03/21/macos-unified-log-3-finding-your-way/">look
for</a>:</p>
<pre><code>=== system boot:
</code></pre><p>and</p>
<pre><code>Previous shutdown cause: 5
</code></pre></li>
<li>Look for boot messages that are <em>not</em> shared between your past three
reboots (see <code>journalctl</code>'s <code>-b</code> flag). Break this task down into
multiple steps. First, find a way to get just the logs from the past
three boots. There may be an applicable flag on the tool you use to
extract the boot logs, or you can use <code>sed '0,/STRING/d'</code> to remove
all lines previous to one that matches <code>STRING</code>. Next, remove any
parts of the line that <em>always</em> varies (like the timestamp). Then,
de-duplicate the input lines and keep a count of each one (<code>uniq</code> is
your friend). And finally, eliminate any line whose count is 3 (since
it <em>was</em> shared among all the boots).</li>
<li>Find an online data set like <a href="https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaZZ.htm">this
one</a>, <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/tables/table-1">this
one</a>.
or maybe one <a href="https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/">from
here</a>.
Fetch it using <code>curl</code> and extract out just two columns of numerical
data. If you&rsquo;re fetching HTML data,
<a href="https://github.com/EricChiang/pup"><code>pup</code></a> might be helpful. For JSON
data, try <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/"><code>jq</code></a>. Find the min and
max of one column in a single command, and the sum of the difference
between the two columns in another.</li>
