      <description>11 Relationships: friends forever A : Friendship Friends are people who are much more than meet casual acquaintances. True friens are always there when you need them, as you are for them. We expect loyalty from our friends, despite our fault, and should give it in return, never speaking ill of them behind their backs. As well as having friends and casul acquaintances, we have relationships with colleagues, allies and partners.</description>
